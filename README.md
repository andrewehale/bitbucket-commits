# bitbucket-commits
I needed a quick script to count the total number of commits for each contributer per year so I threw this together. This is specific to bitbucket server. I believe bitbucket cloud is a slightly different API.

To use this script update the user, password, and year fields in the script and run it. It will return a list of each committer with total number of commits across all repositories. Could be modified slightly to look at different ranges but right now it is set up for an entire calendar year.
